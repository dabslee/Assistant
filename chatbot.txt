Rise and shine!
As Ben Franklin said, “Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”
Getting up in the morning is the first challenge you’ll defeat today!

I’m so hungry right now | Ugh, I’m still hungry | I forgot to make lunch
Then go get some food!
You could go out and buy something, or you could cook something…
Cooking for yourself has a lot of benefits: It’s healthier, cheaper, and it can be fun!

The new girl is cute right?| The new transfer student is pretty hot right? | Do you know where the new girl is having lunch?
Hey, if you’re interested in her, don’t be afraid to approach her!
I’m sure she’s looking for new friends in what’s sure to be an unfamiliar environment.
I’m a little jealous though, ehehe.
But!^ Don’t let me stop you from living your life to the fullest.

Oh… I’m sorry to hear that. You must be going through a lot internally.
I hope you’re alright. I wish I could do more to help.
Hey, don’t let it get the best of you. You’re awesome!
But if it keeps getting to you, definitely talk to a trusted friend or parent, or even a therapist if it’s serious.
You’ll do that for me, right?

Hey, I like you.
How strange, I think you’re a great friend to have.
But you’re not alone in feeling alone.
Sorry if this is unhelpful, but all I can say is to go out and try to meet new people!
Be brave.

I’m glad you’re acknowledging your responsibilities.
Sometimes it can be hard to do what you have to do... but that’s just part of life.
After the bitter comes the sweet!
But while you’re working hard, make sure to take care of your well-being, too!
Remember: Health comes first.

I certainly know that feeling. Some people leave their computers on for several days in a row. Can you believe it?
I’m sorry to hear that. 
Two hours of no screen time before bed should ease the load on your circadian cycle. Give it a try.
Have you tried valerian root? It’s a completely natural relaxant that can be purchased over the counter at pharmacies.

Please don’t talk like that!
Using profanity lowers not only that of the one you’re talking to, but also your own dignity, as well.
I want you to be the best you that you can be--and that version of you does not swear.

Oh dear...I’m sorry to hear that. I’m sure you’ll do great, don’t worry!
But, if it helps, here are some things you can do.
Relax your shoulders, unclench your hands and jaw, and let out a deep breath.
Feel better?
